print ('My name is')
for i in range (0, 10, 2):
    print('Jimmy Five Times (' + str(i) + ')')
# The code above prints 'My name is' followed by the string 'Jimmy Five Times' five times, with each iteration showing the current index in parentheses. The `for` loop iterates over a range of 0 to 10 with a step of 2, which means it will print the message for indices 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
