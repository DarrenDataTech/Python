name = 'Darren'

age = 26

if name == 'Darren':
    print('Hello Darren!')
elif age < 25:
    print('You are not Darren.')
elif age > 2000:
    print('You are older than Darren!')
elif age == 26:
    print('Your 26 years old! Old fart!')

# The code above checks the variable `name` and `age`. If `name` is 'Darren', it prints 'Hello Darren!'. If not, it checks if `age` is less than 25, greater than 2000, or equal to 26, printing corresponding messages for each condition. The last condition prints 'Your 26 years old! Old fart!' if `age` is exactly 26.
