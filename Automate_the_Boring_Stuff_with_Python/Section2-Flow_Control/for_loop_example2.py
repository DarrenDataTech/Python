print ('My anme is')

for i in range (5):
    print('Jimmy Five Times (' + str(i) + ')')

# The code above prints 'My anme is' followed by the string 'Jimmy Five Times' five times, with each iteration showing the current index in parentheses. The `for` loop iterates over a range of 5, which means it will print the message for indices 0 through 4.
